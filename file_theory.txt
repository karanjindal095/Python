# open() = opens file
open("folder_name/file name", "mode")
f = open('python/myfile27.txt','r')

mode = it is a parameter which tells the type of file should open

#  The  mode can be :
 01 'r' = for reading
 02 'w' = for writing
 03 'a' = for appending

# Modes in file :
There are various types of modes to open a file
01. read(r)   = for reading file   and it is the default mode if no mode as a argument passed
02. write(w)  = for writing file   and also creates new file and it rewrites the file 
03. append(a) = for appending file and also creates new file
04. create(x) = for creating file  and gives error if file already exists 
05. text(t)   = for text file      and eg open("file_name"," rt ")      
06. binary(b) = for binary file    and eg open("file_name"," rb ")

# with statement 
syntax : with open(A1 , A2) as f: 
Through this there is no need to use close() function

# Methods in file
01. readline()   method = reads only one line
02. redlines()   method = reads every line and creates list of all lines
03. writelines() method = writes all elements of list, tuple etc in file

# functions in file_name
01. seek()     = f.seek(5) it will start after 5 bytes in file.
               data = f.read(6) it will read 6 bytes after the first five seeked bytes.   
02. tell()     = f.tell() it will tell how many bytes are seeked
03. truncate() = f.truncate(250) it will set the size of bytes in file
